questions on lops and object in javascript

Sure! Here are some similar problems to practice with:

1. **Find the Lowest Salary:**
   Write a function `lowestSalary(salaries)` that returns the name of the person with the lowest salary.

2. **Count Properties:**
   Write a function `countProperties(obj)` that returns the number of properties (keys) in an object.

3. **Find the Longest Name:**
   Write a function `longestName(names)` that returns the name with the most letters in an object where the keys are names and the values are their lengths.

4. **Total Salaries:**
   Write a function `totalSalaries(salaries)` that returns the sum of all the salaries in the object.

5. **Find a Key by Value:**
   Write a function `findKeyByValue(obj, value)` that returns the key corresponding to a given value. For example, given `{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}` and `value = 2`, it should return `"b"`.

6. **Filter Salaries Above a Threshold:**
   Write a function `filterSalaries(salaries, threshold)` that returns an array of names with salaries above a certain threshold.

7. **Multiply All Salaries:**
   Write a function `multiplySalaries(salaries, multiplier)` that multiplies each salary by a given multiplier and returns the new object.
